        <p>I am a software engineer with a Bachelor's degree in Aerospace Engineering from the University of California San Diego. My love for technology has been life long and as a highly detail focused individual, I enjoyed learning to create aesthetically pleasing and functionally innovative digital platforms. With these skills now in my arsenal, I am in search of a role that seeks to maximize my technical abilities to the benefit of the companyâ€™s growth and challenges me to further develop my own skills.</p>
        <p>In my free time I enjoy plane watching, hiking, and photography!</p>
